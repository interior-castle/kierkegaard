# Purity of Heart Is to Will One Thing

## Preface

I find Kierkegaard's statement that he is in search of "that solitary 'individual'" compelling. How can you not want to be that individual who "reads willingly and slowly, who reads over and over again, and who reads aloud — for his own sake." But am I that man? Of course I *want* to be.

## Chapter 1: Man and the Eternal

Kierkegaard's opening reminds me of the opening to St. Augustine's *Confessions*. Striking.

He opens with a meditation on Ecclesiastes: "To everything there is a season." In what sense are these words meant? Ultimately, there must be something unchanging about them. If these are merely the words of an old man, then he is looking back on his life and seeing the phases that no longer apply to him. He would be like the flower, about to wither and die in autumn, recalling its prime of life in spring. And when the flower was in spring, how could it then have grasped the reality of its doom in autumn and seen both events as being the same kind of phenomena?

To this beginning Kierkegaard adds a beautiful observation. Imagine that the flower, about to die, laid out its seasons of life and then added, "The story is not over, for when I am dead, I am immortal." A jarring idea, but then this is precisely what a man must add if making the same sort of limited account of his life. Immortality then cannot be a "final alteration that crept in," it must infuse meaning into everything when we look at all things as seasons of life. It must be present in every moment and at every change. It must be present in the human heart; we must read that verse from Ecclesiastes with another: "God made all things beautiful in his time; also he hath set eternity within man’s heart."
